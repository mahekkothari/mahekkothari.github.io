Iâ€™m a data science student with a minor in bioinformatics at San Jose State Univeristy.

## Work
Spent the better half of university allocating my time and energy in creating accessible tech, and fostering better innovation ecosystems at Vialto Partners, SJCG, & SheFi. Over the past year, I conducted research on campus focusing on biotech and promoter sequencing. 

## Personal

In my free time I tend to spend it reading, going on walks, and journaling. Being able to make memories worth remembering is a privilege, that's why I spend a lot of my time taking pictures and scrapbooking.
