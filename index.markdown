Iâ€™m a data science student at San Jose State Univeristy, graduating in May 2027. 

## Work

Building an inclusive world means a lot to me -- that's why I have allocated so much time and energy in creating accessible tech, and fostering better innovation ecosystems at Vialto Partners, SJCG, & SheFi.

## Personal

In my free time I tend to spend it reading, going on (comically) long walks, and journaling. Being able to make memories worth remembering is a privilege, that's why I spend a lot of my time taking pictures and scrapbooking.
